/**
 * Feature Flags Configuration
 *
 * Controls which modules and features are visible in the UI.
 * Module code stays in the repo as reference implementations —
 * these flags just hide them from the sidebar and settings.
 *
 * When forking this starter:
 * - Set VITE_FEATURE_[NAME]=false in .dev.vars to hide modules you don't need
 * - The module code remains available as patterns for Claude Code to reference
 *
 * TWO FLAG LAYERS EXIST — they deliberately do NOT interact:
 * - THIS file (VITE_FEATURE_*, build-time): which starter MODULES are
 *   visible. Fork-time decisions, baked into the bundle, gate nav +
 *   routes. This is the only layer the starter itself gates on.
 * - The `feature-flags` module (D1 + admin UI, runtime): a reference
 *   implementation for toggling YOUR product's features without a
 *   redeploy. Copy the pattern for your own domain flags; it does not
 *   override anything here. Client hook: `useFeatures.ts`
 *   (usePublicFeatures / useAdminFeatures).
 *
 * @see src/shared/config/nav.ts for sidebar item filtering
